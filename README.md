# ckDarkmode
Quick darkmode css mod for the CryptoKitties website. The CSS is functional for the current build of CryptoKitties (12/24/18) 
as a minimalist-design darkmode, and is updated in response to their site changes/as I come across features that need tweaking to be
viewed with darkmode.


Installation:
Implemented using the "User JavaScript and CSS" extension for Chrome, code pasted into the righthand 'CSS' side 
and saved for the CryptoKitties domain.

The extension is not my own, and can be found here:
